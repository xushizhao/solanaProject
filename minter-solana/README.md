# iNFT Minter
- Isolate Dapp for iNFT, it is not the same as normal NFT, need a minter to show the proper result.

## Feathers
- No wallet needed at first stage, just a password to encode and decode the private key.

## Todo
- The program is not ready, just call an empty one to get the transaction result then have the slot hash to render the iNFT result.
- Need to integrate the Compressed NFT and Excutabe NFT, as the low cost of storage, it is a great way to public huge numbers of NFT, new playing way will break out.
- Temlpate data is mocked. The iNFT definition as the template is JSON format, need to storage on a Solana account. But it is not implement yet.
