iNFT, Identifiable NFT, is an efficient method of generating NFTs based on mathematical randomness, producing visually distinguishable results.

As we all know, there are two major issues with current NFTs: the limited-time limited-edition issuance model and the massive on-chain storage space. Famous NFTs like the Bored Ape Yacht Club have limited total numbers, and each series takes up a large amount of storage space.

Additionally, one of the most important principles of blockchain is the random and unique nature of hash values. Utilizing random hash values to generate a new NFT is what our iNFT does. This allows the randomness of the hash to be visually recognizable.

Let's look at two examples:

First, the famous Bored Ape Yacht Club. We upload a preprocessed image and combine it with the random hash of the blockchain transaction to select corresponding image fragments. Here, we select 16 local image blocks. Next, we combine the images to generate the NFT on the right. This set of casting rules allows the quality of the result to be visually recognizable.

Similarly, let's try with the Solana logo. Using hash values to select corresponding blocks, we generate the logo on the right. Unlike other NFT images that are difficult to distinguish, we can easily differentiate their quality, which is based on their rarity.

Therefore, now we only need 1% of the on-chain storage space of regular NFT issuances, storing a single image and its corresponding retrieval rules, to generate countless results. This, combined with Solana's ecosystem of xNFTs and cNFTs (Compressed NFTs), makes the large-scale issuance of entertaining and playful NFTs an extremely low-cost endeavor.

iNFT creates new ways of playing with NFTs, transforming the reliance on rarity into a more inclusive, low-entry barrier "gacha" model. Combined with the web3.0 ecosystem, it will greatly assist in some fundraising activities, ecosystem publicity releases, and revitalizing the dormant NFT market.

Now, let me briefly introduce three innovative gameplay modes that we are communicating with partners and preparing to implement one by one.

1. iNFT combined with fundraising will become a fun way of donation.
Different from traditional donations, the iNFT method not only utilizes blockchain technology to leave donation records and achieve financial isolation but also mints some random NFTs. These scarce NFTs are also marketable and tradable on the NFT market. This method is both fun and meaningful, and participants may receive unexpected returns. In the low-cost issuance model of iNFTs, this fun method can be applied to various donation scenarios.

2. The highly gamified iNFT can greatly stimulate popularity and bring huge traffic.
For example, users participating in game promotion activities receive daily airdrops to mint iNFTs, and the game issuer reclaims minted iNFTs based on their rarity. This provides users with an enjoyable experience, surpassing simple token acquisition, turning the process into a fun game, and offering unexpected additional returns. This approach can rapidly expand the number of participants, making promotion and marketing effortless, while also being very cost-effective.

3. iNFT can quickly activate dormant assets.
Obviously, using the iNFT method, new gameplay can be created for dormant assets. Currently, some expensive NFTs are actually difficult to trade. In this case, iNFT issuance of gacha games can be used. When a user draws a specified random result, the ownership of the expensive NFT is transferred. In this process, the owner of the expensive NFT activates their asset, and players participating in the game can obtain the expensive NFT at a low price, with the iNFT issuer receiving a share of the profit. Currently, negotiations are underway with multiple NFT owners.

In conclusion, iNFT is an innovative way of issuing NFTs, bringing fair and fun web3 methods into commercial scenarios. This will be an interesting journey.
